# How a Bitcoin transaction moves through the network
## 1. There is no “submit to Bitcoin”

When a Bitcoin transaction is created, it is not sent to a central system.

There is:

    1. no global inbox
    2. no master node
    3. no authoritative entry point

Instead, Bitcoin operates as a peer-to-peer gossip network.

Broadcasting a transaction means:

    *sharing it with a few peers and trusting the network to do the rest.*

This immediately explains an important reality:

    Different nodes learn about transactions at different times — or not at all.

## 2. The peer-to-peer network (who talks to whom)

Every Bitcoin node maintains connections to a limited number of peers:

    a. some inbound
    b. some outbound

There is no global view of the network.

Each node:

    1. chooses peers independently
    2. has partial visibility of the system
    3. only knows what its peers tell it

This design is intentional:

    1. it avoids central points of failure
    2. it prevents easy network-level control
    3. it makes censorship harder

But it also means information spreads gradually, not instantly.

## 3. Broadcasting a transaction: first contact

When Adi’s wallet broadcasts a transaction, it typically:

    sends it to one or a few nodes

    often nodes operated by the wallet itself or trusted peers


At this point:

    the transaction exists only locally

    most of the network has never seen it

Those first nodes perform basic checks:

    transaction format

    basic validity

    policy checks

If a node rejects the transaction, propagation stops at that path.

If it accepts the transaction, it becomes a candidate for gossip.

## 4. Gossip propagation: spreading by repetition

Accepted transactions propagate through the network via gossip:

    1.A node learns about a new transaction

    2.It announces this transaction to its peers

    3.Interested peers request the full transaction

    4.The process repeats

No node sends transactions to everyone.
No node knows who has already seen it.

Propagation is:

    redundant

    unordered

    probabilistic

This redundancy is a feature:

    it tolerates node failures

    it tolerates network partitions

    it resists censorship

## 5. Why some nodes see your transaction earlier than others

There are several reasons transaction visibility varies:

**Network topology**
Some nodes are:

    better connected

    geographically closer

    online more consistently

These nodes learn faster.

**Policy differences**
Nodes apply local mempool policies.

A transaction that:

    pays a low fee

    uses uncommon scripts

    violates standardness rules

may be:

    accepted by some nodes

    rejected or ignored by others

This creates uneven propagation.

**Bandwidth and latency**
Bitcoin runs on the public internet.

Propagation is affected by:

    network congestion

    routing paths

    physical distance

There is no concept of “instant broadcast”.

## 6. Mempools are local, not global

A common misconception:

*    “The transaction is in the mempool.”*

In reality:

    there is no single mempool

    every node has its own mempool

    mempools differ across the network

Two honest nodes can:

    both follow consensus rules

    both be fully synced

    yet have different transactions in their mempools

This is normal and expected.

## 7. What miners see (and what they don’t)

Miners are also nodes.

They:

    receive transactions via the same gossip process

    select transactions from their own mempool

    do not see a global list of pending transactions

This means:

    some miners may see your transaction early

    others may not see it at all

    inclusion timing is probabilistic

There is no guaranteed ordering.

## 8. Latency, not instant visibility

From broadcast to widespread visibility:

    milliseconds to seconds in ideal conditions

    longer during congestion

    sometimes never, if the transaction is rejected

Bitcoin optimizes for:

    correctness

    robustness

    decentralization

It does not optimize for instant awareness.

This tradeoff is deliberate.

9. Common misconceptions

*“Once broadcast, the network knows.”*
No — only some peers know, initially.

*“If my wallet shows ‘sent’, it’s everywhere.”*
No — that only means the wallet broadcast it.

*“Miners immediately see all transactions.”*
No — miners learn through gossip like everyone else.

## 10. Why this design exists

Bitcoin’s propagation model:

    1. avoids central coordination

    2. tolerates partial failures

    3. makes censorship costly

    4. allows independent policy decisions

It sacrifices speed and certainty for resilience.

This is not accidental.
It is foundational to how Bitcoin survives in adversarial environments.

    Why nodes may reject transactions they receive,
    and how policy rules differ from consensus rules.
